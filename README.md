My implementation for the IJCAI 2019 paper "[Joint Link Prediction and Network Alignment via Cross-graph Embedding](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/312)".

The implementation achieves the same results as stated in the paper when there is no noise.

TODO: Improve the accuracy when random noise is added
